    songIntro:
      "<span>The first Divya Desam is Srirangam which is known as Booloka Vaikundam. In puraanaa, it is mentioned that Srirangam Periya perumal in Pranavakruthi vimaanam was worshipped by Lord Brahma in Sathyaloka. When the king Itsuvaahu performed a thapa praying Lord Brahma, he appeared before the king and asked for his requirement. The king prayed for the Periaperumal Lord Renganatha which Brahma offered to him, which he brought to his capital Ayodhi. In Theydhayug, the descendent of Itsuvaahu king Dasaratha along with his sons was worshipping Lord Periaperumal.</span><br /><br /><span>After conquering Ravana, Sri Rama took the crown of the king of Ayodhi. When the festival was over King Vibishana bid good bye to return to Srilanka. At that time SriRama offered him the vigraham of Lord Renganatha. Vibishana was happy and carried the vigraham all the way towards Srilanka. While passing through Tamilnadu, as he became tired he wanted to take rest for a while. He placed the vigraham along with vimanam on the banks of Cauvery in between Kollidam and Cauvery. Getting attracted by the scenic beauty of the place Periaperumal decided to stay there permanently.</span><br /><br /><span>When king Vibishana tried to lift the Vigraham, he could not. He was so sad and with very great sorrow he stayed there for a few days. Chola King Dharma Varma came there and consoled him. With a heavy heart, King Vibishana prayed and started to return to Srilanka. Lord Renganatha appeared in his dream and told him that He decided to stay on the banks of Cauvery upon his own desire, and that, in his lying posture He will face the Southern direction thereby towards Srilanka. King Dharma Varma started constructing a temple for Renganatha which was later on expanded by many kings. Thaayaar name is Renganayaki. This shrine was praised by eleven Aazhvaars out of twelve in Divya prabandham.</span><br /><br /><span>Adiyen composed a krithi on Lord Renganatha during the first outbreak of Covid 19 disease seeking His grace for eradication of this dreaded disease from the world so that all will lead a peaceful life. Set to a raagam called '‡Æö‡Æπ‡Ææ‡Æ©‡Ææ' and Aadhi thaalam I have sung the song along with my wife Mrs Amutha. Please listen and enjoy üôè</span><br /><br />",

When Aazhwaar met the merchant with a measure vessel Palm leaf and writing  nail he said he can change the river sand into gold and pay the workers with a condition that for those who worked sincerely alone will get gold. He said he would record the payments  made to have an account. When many workers did not get gold Aazhwaar thought he was a fraud and tried to beat him.The merchant escaped and started running very fast.Thirumangai tried to follow him in his horse. Finally the merchant reached Thiru Aadhanur and suddenly disappeared when Aazhwaar saw the sayanakolam of Mahavishnu with the same measuring vessel. Palm leaf and writing nail.

The presiding deity is Thiruvikramaperumaal. Urchava moorthy is known as Thaadaalan. In Tamil Thaal means earth or world Aalan means Ruler.This place was believed to be one where Sage Viswamithra conducted yangnga. The place was in ruins for some time while an old lady was believed to have protected the urchava moorthy in a pot of rice bran and worshipped  from whom Thirumangai aazhwaar got the idol and reconstructed the temple  so as continue the pooja systematically. Hence this God is called Thavittupaanai Thaadaalan. By the grace of this Lord Aazhwaar defeated Thiugnana Sambandar in a poetic debate by composing a song Tamil with a count of one two three to seven when Sambandar asked him to construct a small poem called Kural in Tamil.Upon realising Aazhwaar's excellence in Tamil poetic ability Sambandar praised him and gave him his Vel to Aazhwaar. I have composed a Krithi on Lord Thaadaalan and tuned to the raagam Madhuvanthi. Sang with my wife Mrs Amutha. Madhuvanthi is a  raagam Carnatic music borrowed from Hindusthaani music.It was a derived from a raagam known as Dharmavathi. Madhuvanthi literally meaning Honey flowing from flowers. It is a romantic raagam based on foundation  eternity and Colors of love. I have given some Tamil songs in this raagam in separate audios. Please listen and enjoy.</span>",

As per another legend Mahavishnu appeared before Lord Shiva who was performing Rudhra thaandavam because of the demise of his consort Uma in the yanga of Dhaksha. Mahavishnu appeared as Nara-Naraayanan from  Badrinath. All the Devas came to this place to seek the Thirumanthira upadesam from Him. As He spreads the Gnana  just like a ever glowing lamp spreads the light always Thirumangai aazhwaar referred Him as Nanthaa vilakku in his paasuram. This shrine is the place where all other 10 Thirunaangur thiruppathi urchavars will come on Garuda vaaganam for the annual festival of Pathinoru Garuda Sevai on the next day of Thai Amavasai.

This pond (pushkarani)was named after Swethan viz., Swetha pushkarani whichmeans vellai kulam in tamil which later turned to Vellakulam. Thirumangai Aazhvaar once praised Lord Srinivasan of Thirumalai as Anna(elder bother). After that he had not praised any lord of any Divya Desam. But when he visited this shrine he praised this lord as Anna. Hence this lord was considered elder brother of Lord Balaji of Thirumalai. The speciality of this sthalam is that both Lord Srinivasan and Alarmel mangai are seen in the same sannithi unlike Thirumalai where Thaayaar is in the foot of the hill while Srinivasan is seen at the top of the hill.</span>",

Paadma puraanam had a mention about this sthalam .When Arjuna visited this place which was a forest he was so thirsty.He saw Saint Agasthiar wasin thapam. Arjuna requested Agasthiar to provide some water When Agasthiar looked in to his kamandal he saw that it was dry. By his gnana drishti he realised that this was a trick by Lord Krishna.So he questioned  Arjuna that whenever he was facing any problem he used to seek the help of Krishna and why he didn't do this time.Arjuna realised his mistake and prayed to Lord Krishna who appeared before him and gave him a sword (Khatgam in Sanskrit) and asked him to dig the earth.Upon digging the soil Ganges came out as a fountain and became a pond which is known as Khtaga theertham. Just like kurukshetra Lord Krishna made Upadesam to Arjuna in this place also and hence it was originally known as Parthasarathi palli which later on changed as Parthan palli. Adiyen composed a krithi on the presiding deity Thaamaraiyal kelvan and Thaayaar Thaamarai naayagi  set to raagam Aabhogi sang with my wife Mrs Amutha.Please listen the audio and see the lyrics of the krithi I have sung a few songs in the raagam Aabhogi given in another audio.

When  Lord Mahavishnu fought with asuras he became thirsty Aadhiseshanor Vaheendran could get potable water by beating the earth with his tail anddigging a well.Garuda too  flew to bring water from  Viraja river but could reach the battle field late. That water flowed as Garuda nadhi. When  a Chozha king who was a core Shaivaire came to this temple and tried to damage the statue of Perumal ,Lord Devanathan appeared before him as Thirumoorthi (as Lord Bramha Lord Shiva and Lord Vishnu)indicating all are one and the same. The king worshipped Lord Devanathan and returned to his palace without doing any damage to the temple and deities.Thirumangai aazhwar praised this Lord in 10 paasurams. The great vaishnava guru swami Vedhantha Desikan reached this shrine and worshipped Lord Hayagriva when Garuda appeared before him and initiated in him Hayagriva upaasana which helped him attatain religious knowledge to its greatest depth. Swami Desikan composed two sanskrit slokas on Devanatha perumal  Devanatha Panchasat and Acchtha Sathakam. In Tamil he made 7 contributions on this Lord namely Mummani kovai, Panthu, Kazhal, Ammaanai, Oosal, Yesal, and Navamani maalai.

He fought with Nakkayran and killed him simultaneously calmed down the anger of Kali. Another incident which had a mention is giving Mukthi to the elephant Gajendran.This incident was again shown by the Lord to Peyaazhwaar when he prayed Him for this.When ThirumangaiAazhwaar visited this shrine to worship the Lord, he was stunned to see the posture as he had never ever seen Thirumaal with 8 hands and 8 weapons.So he wrote the paasurams as who was he .Was He Vishnu or someone else. In another incident in Puraana it was mentioned that when big snake entered the temple it got frightened by the posture of the Lord and surrender ed to Him.This snake Sarabesan was given protection by the Lord and assigned with the work of taking care of Yaga sala of the temple.

      "<span>Thiruneeragam is the 47th Divyadesam situated in Kancheepuram itself in the Kamatchi Amman sannathi street. The presiding deity is Urchavar with the name Jagadheeswara perumal and there is no moolavr. The shrine is situated inside the temple of another Divyadesam namely Thiruooragam. Thaayaar name is Nilamangaivalli. When Rishi Maarkandeyar requested Lord Mahavishnu to show the avatar he is going to take at the tome of Pralayam (end of the world) He showed him that he was going to be like a small baby on a baniyan leaf which will float on the furious flood water. Perumal has also a name Neeragathaan. It symbolises that as water rushes towards the place  where there is a small opening or hole this Lord flows in to the hearts of Bhakthas and fill their souls. ThirumangaiAazhwaar praised this Lord in one paasuram. Adiyen composed a Krithi on this Lord tuned to the raagam Gowri manohari sang with my wife Mrs Amutha.</span>",

      "<span>Welcome to our musical journey to 48th Divyadesam Thiruppadagam located in Periya Kancheepuram near Gangaikondan mandapam. Moolavr is Pandava Thoothan with a sitting posture facing east. During the period of Mahabharatha Lord Krishna when visited Hasthinapura to meet Kauravas as Pandava Thoothan he was tried to be trapped by Duriodhana through seating on a chair arranged on a false platform made of dried grass so that when he sat on it he was taken down to the basement of the palace where he had to fight with wrestlers who were ready to kill him. After conquering them Krishna showed his giagantic swaroop vishwaroopam to Kauravas including Dhritarashtra the blind king and father of Duriyodhana . When Krishna offered a boon to Dhritarashtra he requested Krishna to make him again blind as he didn't want to see any other thing after the Dharshan of vishwaroopam of Lord Krishna .After hundreds of years of Mahabharatha war the King Jename jeyan who was the great grand son of Pandavas wanted to see the vishwaroopam of Pandava Thoothan his guru Rishi Vaisambayanar advised him to go to Kancheepuram and perform aswamedha yaagam and pray to Lord Vishnu.He did accordingly and upon hearing his prayer Lord Krishna showed him his Vishwaroopam as Pandava Thoothan at this sthalam. One can see such a big deity  ( 25feet tall) in a sitting posture only in this shrine. Thaayaar Rukmini and Sathya bama. Pada means Big .Agam means Residence signifying Thiruppadagam as the place where Lord Mahavishnu resides with his great form. Peyaazhwaar Bhoothathaazhwar Thirumazhisai aazhwaar and ThirumangaiAazhwaar worshipped this shrine and sang paasurams in praise of this deity. Adiyen composed a Krithi on Pandava Thoothan of Thiruppadagam and sang with my wife Mrs Amutha in the raagam Karaharapriya. Please listen the audios and enjoy.</span>",

When Goddess Parvathi had to be born as Kaathyayani due to shapa of Easwaran was brought up by Rishi Kathyayanar. He asked Kathyayani to perform a sincere Penance to reunite with Lord Shiva.So she started doing the penance under a mango tree standing with one leg on a needle unde a mango tree in this place.When Lord Shiva wanted to her patience he burnt the mango tree with the fire which he released from his third eye on the forehead. Parvathi immediately prayed to her brother Shreeman Narayanan who came to her rescue.With his cool rays as that of a moon he not only brought down the heat on her body but also made the burnt mango tree to re grow which turned back to fully green .  By this Parvathi could complete her Penance and got married to Lord Shiva again.As Lord Mahavishnu is emitting cold rays of moon light and broke down the trouble came to Parvathi's Penance He was known as Nilathingal Thundathaan. Thirumangai Aazhwar praised this shrine in one paasuram. In his Nootriyettu Thiruppathi Anthadhi Saint Pillaiperumal Iyengaar also praised this Lord. Thaayaar name is Neroruvar illaa valli naachiyaar .It is reported that once there was a separate shrine for this thaayaar in the temple.But now there is no separate sannathi for thaayaar.

When the Pallava king vamsam didn't have a child it was said that Lord Mahavishnu himself appeared as a hunter along with Mahalakshmi and gave a child (who was born to sage Bharathwaja and a lady from the heaven ) to the then Pallava King. The king named him as Parameswaran.He has been a sincere devotee of Lord Vishnu and constructed this temple. Gracing his prayer Lord Vishnu himself appeared before him and taught him 18 fine -arts.As the lord was teaching him the arts He showed the king all his three postures namely standing,sitting and lying. So the Pallava king constructed a three storied temple in which in the ground floor the lord was sculptured in his standing posture and in the first floor in his sitting posture while in second floor in his lying posture. Thaayaar name is Vaikuntha Valli . Thirumangai Aazhvaar who was the contemporary of this Pallava king praised this Paramapatha naadhan in 10 paasurams. Adiyen composed a krithi on this shrine tuned to a raagam ‡Æ®‡Æ≥‡Æø‡Æ©‡Æï‡Ææ‡Æ®‡Øç‡Æ§‡Æø, sang with my wife Mrs. Amutha.I have given some songs in this raagam.

In both the places it was said that Lord Rama performed the final rituals for Jadaayu who came to rescue Sita while she was taken by Ravana in pushpaka Vimanam to Srilanka. At the time of performing rituals Rama kept the body of Jadaayu on his lap right side. Due to the smell of the burning body of Jadaayu Sridevi usually on the right side Vishnu (born as Rama) moved to his left side. Rama by sending an arrow brought a holy water as a pond to perform the final rituals .This pond is named as Jadaayu pushkarani. The temple authorities are of the opinion that the final rituals of Jadaayu performed by Lord Rama at Pullam Boothankudi was reenacted based on the request of Jadaayu put forth to Lord Narayana at Vaikuntam. He made the submission to Narayanan to give the same dharshan to all devotees coming to this shrine. The Thaayaar name is Maragathavalli. Those women who are not blessed with child are asked to take bath in the Jadaayu pushkarani along with their respective husband. The priest of this temple hand over a small quantity of roasted pulses or other grains.Those ladies are asked to have these roasted grains after soaking in water and tying in their sarees.They have to sleep near the sannidhi of Thaayaar along with the grains in their sarees.The next day morning the grains will be examined.If these roasted grains start germinating they are sure to get the blessings of Thaayaar for pregnancy and healthy child.Hence the Thaayaar has a name '‡Æµ‡Æ±‡ØÅ‡Æ§‡Øç‡Æ§ ‡Æ™‡ÆØ‡Æ±‡ØÅ ‡ÆÆ‡ØÅ‡Æ≥‡Øà‡Æµ‡Æø‡Æ§‡Øç‡Æ§ ‡Æ§‡Ææ‡ÆØ‡Ææ‡Æ∞‡Øç'. This shrine has another importance. Aachariyar Ramanujarhad his early lessons of Vedhas here only in the gurukula of Yaadhava prakaasar. Adiyen composed a krithi on this shrine tuned to a raagam ‡Æï‡Æ≤‡Øç‡ÆØ‡Ææ‡Æ£ ‡Æµ‡Æö‡Æ®‡Øç‡Æ§‡ÆÆ‡Øç sang with my wife Mrs Amutha. Please listen and enjoy. </span>",

It is about a mile away from Arakkonam railway station.The Sthala puranam goes like this.Once when Goddess Lakshmi at Thiruppaarkadal had a difference of opinion with her father Thiruppaarkadal arasan and with anger she came down to earth and reached this place. She stood here.Since Lakshmi is known as ‡Æ§‡Æø‡Æ∞‡ØÅ in Tamil this place was called as ‡Æ§‡Æø‡Æ∞‡ØÅ‡Æ®‡Æø‡Æ©‡Øç‡Æ±‡Æµ‡ØÇ‡Æ∞‡Øç. Thiruppaarkadal arasan came here and prayed to Lakshmi to calm down and come back to Thiruppaarkadal. But she didn't. So he went to Lord Mahavishnu and prayed to console her.So Lord Mahavishnu came here and pacified her.So Lakshmi cooled down and offered the posture of marriage with Lord Vishnu to Thiruppaarkadal arasan.He was happy and prayed them to show this to all bhakthaas. With great affinity to his daughter Thiruppaarkadal arasan called Lakshmi as ‡Æé‡Æ©‡Øç‡Æ©‡Øà‡Æ™‡Øç ‡Æ™‡ØÜ‡Æ±‡Øç‡Æ± ‡Æ§‡Ææ‡ÆØ‡Ææ‡Æ∞‡Øç. Since the Lord Mahavishnu came down based on his bhakthan's prayer he got the name ‡Æ™‡Æï‡Øç‡Æ§‡Æµ‡Æ§‡Øç‡Æö‡Æ≤‡Æ™‡Øç ‡Æ™‡ØÜ‡Æ∞‡ØÅ‡ÆÆ‡Ææ‡Æ≥‡Øç. Once when Thirumangai aazhwaar crossed this shrine he didn't compose any paasuram on this deity (probably the temple wouldn't have been open). Realising this Thaayaar requested Perumal to go and meet Aazhwaar and get the paasuram. Bhakthavathsala Perumal followed Aazhwaar and could reach him only at Thirukadal mallai (Mahabalipuram) where he was praising Thalasayana perumal.Upon seeing him at this shrine Aazhvaar praised him also in in  paasuram. Perumal came back to Thirunindravur and showed the paasuram to Lakshmi when she asked him whether he could get only one paasuram and asked him to go back to Aazhvaar and get some more. Lord Vishnu again came in search of Aazhvaar by that time Aazhvaar reached Thirukkannamangai. Upon seeing the lord's arrival again Aazhvaar composed one more paasuram on him and Perumal came back to Thirunindravur and showed it to Thaayaar and made her happy. Adiyen composed a krithi on this shrine tuned to Shree raagam sang with my wife Mrs Amutha. Please listen and enjoy üôè</span>",

The shrine was quoted in Markandeya purana. During Krutha Yuga Burupunniya and his wife performed an yaga called Sali yanga at Badri seeking blessings of Lord Narayana for a child.Lord Narayanan blessed them and asked them to name their son Salihothran.When Salihothran became an adult he took up an yathra to different shines and holy places. He reached a forest here and saw a pond where Devas used to come and take a holy dip in it. He constructed a hut with a parnashala and performed Pooja regularly.Everyday he used to feed a guest and then only had his food. One day he had wait for a long time for the arrival of a guest. Lord Narayana came in a disguise as an old man for his house as a guest on that day. Salihothra was very happy to receive him and offered food.After taking food the old man told him that he was very tired and wanted to lie down and sleep.He asked Salihithra where was the room to sleep (‡Æé‡Æµ‡Øç‡Æµ‡ØÅ‡Æ≥‡Øç). Saint Salihothra showed a small place near his parnashala and told this was the place to sleep (‡Æá‡Æµ‡Øç‡Æµ‡ØÅ‡Æ≥‡Øç). When the guest in the disguise of anold man lied down he showed that he was Lord Narayana.Saint Salihothra was very happy to the lord in front of him when Lord Narayana asked him his wish. He immediately requested that Lord may please remain there permanently in that posture and bless all bhakthaas. Lord Narayana accepted and blessed him with his hand on the head of Salihothra. Moolavar Veeraragava perumal is also known as ‡Æé‡Æµ‡Øç‡Æµ‡ØÅ‡Æ≥‡Øç ‡Æï‡Æø‡Æü‡Æ®‡Øç‡Æ§‡Ææ‡Æ©‡Øç Thaayaar name is ‡Æï‡Æ©‡Æï‡Æµ‡Æ≤‡Øç‡Æ≤‡Æø (‡Æµ‡Æ∏‡ØÅ‡ÆÆ‡Æ§‡Æø) The holy theertham (pond) in this shrine was supposed to destroy the sins of the devotees. Lord Shiva (Rudra) was also said to have been relieved of his sins he got by killing  Dhaksha when he came here took bath and prayed Lord Veeraragava perumal. By taking bath in the theertham of this shrine and praying Lord , the diseases one experience get cured and  hence he is called ‡Æµ‡Øà‡Æ§‡Øç‡Æ§‡Æø‡ÆØ ‡Æµ‡ØÄ‡Æ∞‡Æ∞‡Ææ‡Æï‡Æµ ‡Æ™‡ØÜ‡Æ∞‡ØÅ‡ÆÆ‡Ææ‡Æ≥‡Øç.

The temple is a 6th century one located near the sea shore of Bay of Bengal in Chennai. This shrine was reported in Brahmanda purana as forest with a dense population of holy herb Thulasi. Once a king named Sumathi was praying to Lord Venkatesha at Thirumala to show his appearance of Partha Sarathi to him.Lord Venkatesha directed  him to go to this place and see that . On that direction the king reached here and saw the Partha Sarathi roopa of Lord Vishnu.That is why the lord here is known as Venkata Krishna meaning the Krishna shown by Venkatesha of Thirumala to his devotee King Sumathi. The presiding deity in the main Sanctum sanctorum is Lord Krishna in a standing posture with his characteristic mustache as he was the driver (sarathy)of the chariot of Partha(Arjuna). In this Sanctum sanctorum itself in addition to Lord Krishna five other deities are also seen. They are Rukmini Thaayaar, Balaraman(elder brother of Krishna), Saathyagi (a great Yaadhava warrior devoted to Kishna and who took training in shooting arrows under Dhrona along with Arjuna during their early days of schooling), Pradyumna (eldest son of Krishna and Rukmini), Aniruddha son of Pradyumna (grand son of Krishna). The urchavar is Partha Sarathi with characteristic hit impressions of arrows on his face at Kurukshetra. In addition to these presiding deities four other forms of Lord Vishnu are seen in 4 different Sanctums. They are Lord Narasimha ( as per the prayers of sage Atthiri),Lord Rama( as per the prayers of Madhuman Rishi),Lord Gajendra varadhar( as per the prayers of Saint Saptharomar ), Lord Renganathan (as per the wishes of Vadavalli Thaayaar). This shrine was praised by PeyAazhwaar, Thirumazhisai Aazhvaar and Thirumangai aazhwaar in Divyaprabandham. Adiyen composed a krithi on Venkata Krishnan of Thiruvallikeni tuned to the raagam ‡Æï‡Æ≤‡Ææ‡Æµ‡Æ§‡Æø sang with my wife Mrs Amutha.I have shown a few Tamil songs in this raagam.

To satisfy his prayers Lord Renganatha came in the roopa of Rama while Lakshmi as Sita Aadhiseshan as Lakshmana ,Shang as Bharatha Chakkara as Chathrukina Vishwaksenar as Sugreeva and Garudan as Hanuman. Valmiki prayed to show the Neervannan roopa(Rama)to all bakthas who visit this temple which the lord accepted. Once Thirumangai aazhwaar came here for dharshan when there was a heavy  continuous rains .The entire hill was surrounded by water for a period of six months.He waited in the nearby village till the rains stopped and the water drained completely.He reached the temple and worshipped the lord by composing 19 paasurams.

The presiding deity in the foothill is Neervannan and Thaayaar name is Animaamalar mangai in addition to three other deities on the hill mentioned earlier.

This sthalam is mentioned in Varahapuranam. During Krutha Yuga Lord Narayana appeared as Varaha roopi before king Bali for his thapa at this place and this place was known as Vamakavipuri or Varahapuri.In yet another time one Rishi Kalava(based on the request of Saint Naradha) married a rishi daughter called Kuni and they gave birth to 365 daughters who were the incarnation of goddess Lakshmi. When they were trying to get their daughters married a few saints who came from Varahapuri asked them to go there and pray Varaha for the early marriage. Kalavarishi reached Varahapuri and performed thapa.Lord Varaha came there as a bachelor and told him that he had returned after Divyadesa pilgrimage tour. Kalavarishi requested him to marry his 365 daughters.The man replied that he will marry them one by one every day during the year. On the last day he made all the 365 brides in to one roopa called Akilavalli and held her on his left thigh and took Varaha roopa. As the mahalakshmi is on the left side of Varaha he is known as Thiru Ida Enthai. Urchavar is known by the name Nithya kalyana perumal. The name of the first lakshmi (first daughter of Kalavarishi) who married the lord on the first day was Komalavalli .She has a separate sannidhi as a paraellal presiding deity. Many prospective bachelor boys and girls who come to this shrine and pray for early marriage and happy married life.Their requests are fulfilled by this Lord and after marriage they again visit the temple and offer their thanks and gratitude to the lord for His blessings.The Varahamurthy in this shrine was praised by Thirumangai aazhwaar in 13 paasurams.

Most of the temples and carved temples are were constructed by Pallava kings.This is the birth place of Bhoothathaazhvar. In Bhagavatha purana one saint Pundareeka maharishi with lotus flowers in a  basket was trying to worship lying posture of Thirumal in Thiruppaarkadal. When he was interrupted by the ocean he tried to clear the water of ocean. Upon seeing his bhakthi Lord Mahavishnu appeared before him in disguise as an elderly person and asked for food, the rishi handed over the flower basket to him asked him to wait near the sea shore so that he could go back to his hut and bring food. Meanwhile Mahavishnu took his original form adorned himself with the flowers tied by Rishi and had a sleeping posture on Aadhiseshan as in Thiruppaarkadal on the sea shore. When the rishi returned he understood the elderly person he met was none other than Mahavishnu.The rishi was so happy and prayed the lord to bless him by permitting him to sit near His holy feet and lord permitted. Since the Lord laid himself on Aadhiseshan in the ground of sea shore without any throne he was designated as ‡Æ§‡Æ≤‡Æö‡ÆØ‡Æ©‡Æ™‡Øç ‡Æ™‡ØÜ‡Æ∞‡ØÅ‡ÆÆ‡Ææ‡Æ≥‡Øç . Bhoothathaazhvar and Thirumangai aazhwaar praised this lord in their paasurams. Thaayaar name is ‡Æ®‡Æø‡Æ≤‡ÆÆ‡Æô‡Øç‡Æï‡Øà‡Æ§‡Øç ‡Æ§‡Ææ‡ÆØ‡Ææ‡Æ∞‡Øç.

It is about 25 km from Arakonam RS. This sthalam had a mention in Vishnu puranam where it was indicated that sage Viswamithra came to this hill and performed thapa to see Lord Narasimha. When he had the strong prayer for a period of one ‡Æï‡Æü‡Æø‡Æï‡Øà or ‡Æ®‡Ææ‡Æ¥‡Æø‡Æï‡Øà viz., 24 minutes Lord Narasimha appeared before him.Similarly during the end of Thredhayuga Saptharishis when performed thapa to see Lord they were disturbed by two demons Kaalan and Keyan. At that period when Lord Rama was preparing to proceed to Vaikuntam Hanuman wanted to accompany him.Rama told Hanuman to go to this hill fight with the demons to protect the rishis. When Hanuman had a long fight with the demons he became very tired.He prayed Rama for a solution when Rama appeared and gave him Shank and Chakra with those help Hanuman killed them and saved the thapa of rishis. Praising their sustained efforts Mahavishnu appeared as Lord Narasimha which Hanuman also saw and praised Narasimha through Bajan. Lord Narasimha asked Hanuman to stay there in yoga posture similar to him till the end of Kaliyuga. One can see Hanuman in the neighbouring hill in yoga posture with shank and chakra on the shoulders. It is believed that if a person stays in this sthalam and prays for a time of one ‡Æï‡Æü‡Æø‡Æï‡Øà or ‡Æ®‡Ææ‡Æ¥‡Æø‡Æï‡Øà (24 minutes) he or she will be blessed with Mukthi or Moksham. ‡ÆÖ‡Æö‡Æ≤‡ÆÆ‡Øç means hill hence the name ‡Æï‡Æü‡Æø‡Æï‡Ææ‡Æö‡Æ≤‡ÆÆ‡Øç. The presiding deity is Yoga Narasimhar and he is praised as Akkaara kani by Thirumangai aazhwaar in his paasuram. Peyaazhwaar also praised this shrine in his paasuram.Thaayaar name is ‡ÆÖ‡ÆÆ‡Æø‡Æ∞‡Øç‡Æ§ ‡Æµ‡Æ≤‡Øç‡Æ≤‡Æø‡Æ§‡Øç ‡Æ§‡Ææ‡ÆØ‡Ææ‡Æ∞‡Øç. Urchavar name is Bhakthavathsala perumal.

One can reach this sthalam by train in the route from Shoranur to Calicut by getting down at Thirunaavayee railway station which is between Pattaambi and Calicut.The presiding deity is ‡Æ®‡Ææ‡Æµ‡Ææ‡ÆØ‡Øç ‡ÆÆ‡ØÅ‡Æï‡ØÅ‡Æ®‡Øç‡Æ§‡Øç‡Æ§‡Æ©‡Øç and thaayaar name is ‡ÆÆ‡Æ≤‡Æ∞‡Øç‡ÆÆ‡Æô‡Øç‡Æï‡Øà ‡Æ®‡Ææ‡Æö‡Øç‡Æö‡Æø‡ÆØ‡Ææ‡Æ∞‡Øç. Nine Yogis came to this sthalam and performed thapa praying this lord. This shrine is situated on the banks of the river Bharathapuzha and just like Kasi here also rituals for the ancestors are performed. Once Goddess Mahalakshmi and lord Ganapathi (Gajendran) performed puja by plucking flowers and offering to Vishnu. When Mahalakshmi was visiting the garden earlier and plucking flowers Gajendra couldn't get any flowers for puja and so he prayed to Mahavishnu to make flowers available for his Pooja. Mahavishnu told Mahalakshmi not to pluck flowers before Gajendran's visit to garden. When Lakshmi accepted for this Gajendran could get lot of flowers for worship and he was very happy. Mahalakshmi offered equal seat to Gajendra and they both performed the Pooja . Vishnu appeared before them in a standing posture and blessed them. Unlike other Divya Desams in Kerala Lakshmi has a separate sannidhi in this sthalam. Thirumangai aazhwaar praised this perumal through 2 paasurams while Nammazhwaar in 11 paasurams. Adiyen composed a krithi on this lord tuned to the raagam ‡ÆØ‡Æ§‡ØÅ‡Æï‡ØÅ‡Æ≤ ‡Æï‡Ææ‡ÆÆ‡Øç‡Æ™‡Øã‡Æ§‡Æø and sang with my wife Mrs Amutha. I have given a few examples of songs in this raagam.

The presiding deity is Vaamana moorthy who is known by the name ‡Æï‡Ææ‡Æü‡Øç‡Æï‡Æ∞‡Øà‡ÆØ‡Æ™‡Øç‡Æ™‡Æ©‡Øç (‡ÆÖ) ‡ÆÖ‡Æ™‡Øç‡Æ™‡Æ©‡Øç.Thayaar name is ‡Æ™‡ØÜ‡Æ∞‡ØÅ‡Æû‡Øç‡Æö‡ØÜ‡Æ≤‡Øç‡Æµ ‡Æ®‡Ææ‡ÆØ‡Æï‡Æø(‡Æµ‡Ææ‡Æ§‡Øç‡Æ∏‡Æ≤‡Øç‡ÆØ ‡Æµ‡Æ≤‡Øç‡Æ≤‡Æø). This region was once ruled by Asura king Mahabali chakra varthi who was known for his liberal character of giving wealth to saints and  poor people.In fact he was very proud of this trait. Lord Vaamana who was the 5th incarnation of lord Mahavishnu was born on a Thiruvonam star to sage Kashyapa and Adhithi.He was dwarf in stature. Vaamana went to him seeking for a Biksha of three feet land as per the measurement of his own feet. Upon seeing the small stature of the boy and his request Mahabali was laughing and accepted to donate the piece of land to him. Immediately Vaamana took the form of huge figure of Thirivikrama reaching sky height and started measuring the earth and sky with his two feet .When he asked Mahabali where to step for the third feet measurement king Mahabali realised his mistake bowed before Thirivikrama and requested him to step on his head.Mahavishu pushed him to paathaala loka but gave him Mukthi. Based on the request of Mahabali lord permitted him to visit his hometown and citizens once a year that is on the birthday of lord Vaamana the Thiruvonam star of the month Aavani which is celebrated as Oonam. Once a farmer was growing banana crop in this region. Though the growth was good it never came to flowering. So he prayed to Lord Kaatkaraiappan and offered a golden banana bunch to him.After this the crop came to bunching and he had a bumper harvest. In his 11paasurams Swami Nammazhwaar praised this lord. Adiyen composed a krithi on Kaatkaraiappan tuned to the raagam ‡Æö‡Æ®‡Øç‡Æ§‡Æø‡Æ∞‡Æï‡Øå‡Æ©‡Øç‡Æ∏‡Øç. Myself with my wife Mrs Amutha sang and sent as an audio. Please listen and enjoy üôè</span>",

      "<span>The 70th DD Thirukadithanam (‡Æ§‡Æø‡Æ∞‡ØÅ‡Æï‡Øç‡Æï‡Æü‡Æø‡Æ§‡Øç ‡Æ§‡Ææ‡Æ©‡ÆÆ‡Øç) is situated 3km east of a place called Changanassery which is in between Kottayam and Thiruvalla. The Presiding deity is Arputha Narayanan. Tha purana goes like this. Once upon a time from the gardens of the King Rukmankadhan Devas from eternal world used to collect beautiful flowers without his knowledge and offered to the Lord Vishnu for Puja. When the king came to know this he captured all Devas and imprisoned them with the result they could not return to eternal world. When Devas wanted a remedy for this they heard a voice from the air that if king Rukmangatha gives away his 'Punya' of Ekadasi Vridha he adopted to Devas they would be able to return to the divine world. So they prayed the king to help them. King Rukmangatha brought them in front of this deity and gave away all 'Punyas' by which the Devas were relieved of their sin and they reached their divine world. All these were said to have happened in a time of one 'Kadigai' or Naazhingai '‡Æ®‡Ææ‡Æ¥‡Æø‡Æï‡Øà' that is 24 minutes. So it is said that if anybody does a serious prayer for a period of one Kadigai time in this shrine his/her prayers will be fulfilled.If they desire 'Moksha ' and pray for 24 minutes in this shrine it will also be fulfilled by the Lord of this shrine. Among the Panchapandavas, the youngest brother Sahadevan was said to have renovated this temple and worshipped the Lord. Thaayaar name is Karpagavalli Nammazhwaar has praised this Lord in 11 paasurams. Adiyen composed a krithi on this shrine tuned to ragam Hamsanadham ( ‡Æπ‡ÆÆ‡Øç‡Æ∏‡Æ®‡Ææ‡Æ§‡ÆÆ‡Øç) sang along with my wife Mrs. Amutha. Please listen and enjoy.üôè</span>",

When Saptha Rishis visited his country, he demanded that if they make the country to flourish he would give the great Dhaana to them. Agitated Rishis refused that. So the king became angry and performed a yaga from which one ferocious Devatha came to kill the Rishis. When the Rishis prayed to Mahavishnu, he ordered Lord Indra to destroy that devatha. Indra came in the form of a tiger and destroyed him.</p><br/><p>Presiding Deity is Mayapiran and Thaayaar name is Porkodi Naachiaar. Among the Pancha Pandavas, Bhima renovated this shrine.

It is situated about three and half miles North of Chenkannur viz., in between Chenkannur and Thiruvella on the route of Erimelikkarai on the northern side of river Pamba.</p><br/><p>The purana goes like this: Once there was an argument between Brahma and saint Naradha when Brahma cursed him to go to Booloka. So he got down from Sathyaloka and reached this place where he performed Thapa. When Lord Mahavishnu appeared before him Naradha asked about the basis of creation of life. Lord Mahavishnu explained and Naradha understood that every living and non living thing comes from Narayana only who is the sole creator of the Universe. So Naradha wrote this as Naratheya purana. Among the Pancha Pandavas who came to this place Nakula worshipped this Lord and renovated the temple.</p><br/><p>The presiding deity is ‡Æï‡ÆÆ‡Æ≤‡Æ®‡Ææ‡Æ§‡Æ©‡Øç (a) ‡Æ™‡Ææ‡ÆÆ‡Øç‡Æ™‡Æ£‡Øà‡ÆØ‡Æ™‡Øç‡Æ™‡Æ©‡Øç.
