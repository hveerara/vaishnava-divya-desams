      "<span><p>The first Divya Desam is Srirangam which is known as Booloka Vaikundam. In puraanaa, it is mentioned that Srirangam Periya perumal in Pranavakruthi vimaanam was worshipped by Lord Brahma in Sathyaloka. When the king Itsuvaahu performed a thapa praying Lord Brahma, he appeared before the king and asked for his requirement. The king prayed for the Periaperumal Lord Renganatha which Brahma offered to him, which he brought to his capital Ayodhi. In Theydhayug, the descendent of Itsuvaahu king Dasaratha along with his sons was worshipping Lord Periaperumal.</p><p>After conquering Ravana, Sri Rama took the crown of the king of Ayodhi. When the festival was over King Vibishana bid good bye to return to Srilanka. At that time SriRama offered him the vigraham of Lord Renganatha. Vibishana was happy and carried the vigraham all the way towards Srilanka. While passing through Tamilnadu, as he became tired he wanted to take rest for a while. He placed the vigraham along with vimanam on the banks of Cauvery in between Kollidam and Cauvery. Getting attracted by the scenic beauty of the place Periaperumal decided to stay there permanently.</p><p>When king Vibishana tried to lift the Vigraham, he could not. He was so sad and with very great sorrow he stayed there for a few days. Chola King Dharma Varma came there and consoled him. With a heavy heart, King Vibishana prayed and started to return to Srilanka. Lord Renganatha appeared in his dream and told him that He decided to stay on the banks of Cauvery upon his own desire, and that, in his lying posture He will face the Southern direction thereby towards Srilanka. King Dharma Varma started constructing a temple for Renganatha which was later on expanded by many kings. Thaayaar's name is Renganayaki. This shrine was praised by eleven Aazhvaars out of twelve in Divya prabandham.</p><p>Adiyen composed a krithi on Lord Renganatha during the first outbreak of Covid 19 disease seeking His grace for eradication of this dreaded disease from the world so that all will lead a peaceful life. Adiyen composed a song on this sthalam set to a raagam called 'சஹானா' and Aadhi thaalam. Singers are Dr.Thatham and Mrs.Amutha. Please listen and enjoy.</p></span>",

      "<span><p>Dear all, the 3rd Divya Desam is Thirukarambanur. This shrine is situated about 4 kms North of Trichy on the banks of Kollidam. It is about a mile away from Sri Rangam. Brammanda Puranam talks about this shrine.</p><p>When Shiva was angry and removed Lord Brahma's fifth head, he was affected by Brahmahatti Dosha and the skull got stuck on his hand. Lord Shiva wandered around seeking Biksha in the skull. But the rice received as Biksha kept disappearing due to the sin committed by him. When Shiva came to this shrine and asked for Biksha, Goddess Lakshmi gave the Biksha rice and the skull remained full. Hence, Lakshmi in this shrine is known as Poornavathi Thaayar. Brahma came to this shrine and worshipped Lord Vishnu who appeared to him as Kathamba tree. All the three Gods - Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva can be worshipped in this temple. Thirumangai Aazhwar and an Aachariar named Pillai Perumal Iyengar have praised this shrine.</p><p>Adiyen composed a krithi on Lord Purushothaman and tuned it to ragam Bhairavi. Singers are Dr.Thatham and Mrs.Amutha. Please listen and enjoy.</p></span>",

To test him, Muni Dhurvasa came to his hut on an Ekadasi and asked for donating his Ekadasi Punya to him. But rishi Ambarish was in deep dhyana on Mahavishnu. Dhurvasa became angry and cast a 'shapa' on him. When Ambarish prayed to Vishnu to save him from the 'shapa', Mahavishnu sent his 'Chakrayutha' on Dhurvasa. Unable to face the 'Chakrayutha', rishi Dhurvasa prayed to Chakra and Vishnu to forgive him. Lord Mahavishnu forgave him.</p><p>The original temple was built by Ambarish on the banks of Cauvery river but it has been destroyed by the flood. The Moolavar and Urchavar statues were taken by the flood and found by a few fishermen who became the custodian of these statues.</p><p>During this period at Madurai when Queen Mangammal was sleeping, Mahavishnu appeated in her dream and informed about his statues and asked her to collect them from the fishermen and construct a temple for him in the banks of Cauvery.

      "<span><p>This shrine is situated about 3.5 miles away from Kumbakonam. Markandeya, son of Rishi Mirugandu prayed to Lord Vishnu that Mahalakshmi has to come as his daughter on earth and he has to giver her away as the bride to Lord Vishnu so that Mahavishnu himself will become his son-in-law. When he was performing a Thapa at this shrine, goddess Lakshmi appeared as a small baby underneath the Thulasi bush. On a Thiruvonam star, Mahavishnu came in a disguise as an old man and asked Markandeya to give him his daughter in marriage. Without knowing that the old man was none other than Vishnu, Markandeya told his daughter is too young and she does not even know the amount of salt to add when cooking food. If she forgets to add salt to her husband's cooked food, he may get angry. Upon hearing this the old man replied that he was even prepared to eat saltless food if it were cooked by his daughter, and that he definitely wanted to marry her. When Markandeya prayed to Lord Vishnu, Vishnu appeared before him and said that it was him in the disguise of an old man. Rishi Markandeya was happy to give his daughter's hand in marriage to Lord Vishnu.<p>As a custom, till this day, Prasadham at this shrine is cooked without salt. The deity is known as Uppiliappan. Thaayar Mahalakshmi is in the form of Bhoomidevi. This shrine was praised by Nammazhwar in 11 paasurams, by Thirumangaiazhwar in 34 paasurams, Poigaiaazhwar in 1 paasuram and Peyazhwar in 2 paasurams.</p></p><p>Adiyen composed a krithi on this shrine and tuned to ragam Anandabhairavi. Singers are Dr.Thatham and Mrs.Amutha. Please listen and enjoy.</p></span>",

Arjuna requested Agasthiar to provide some water. When Agasthiar looked in to his kamandal he saw that it was dry. By his gnana drishti he realised that this was a trick by Lord Krishna. So he questioned Arjuna that whenever he was facing any problem he used to seek the help of Krishna and why he didn't do this time. Arjuna realised his mistake and prayed to Lord Krishna who appeared before him and gave him a sword (Khatgam in Sanskrit) and asked him to dig the earth. Upon digging the soil Ganges came out as a fountain and became a pond which is known as Khtaga theertham. Just like kurukshetra Lord Krishna made Upadesam to Arjuna in this place also and hence it was originally known as Parthasarathi palli which later on changed as Parthan palli.</p><p>Adiyen composed a krithi on the presiding deity Thaamaraiyal kelvan and Thaayaar Thaamarai naayagi  set to raagam Aabhogi.

      "<span><p>This shrine is situated in the Kancheepuram town at Chinnakancheepuram. It was praised in Paadmapuranam.</p><p>Once when Lord Brahma wanted to perform yagna without Saraswathi's participation, Saraswathi tried to stop the yagna by taking the form of a river named Vegavathi. To protect the yagna, Lord Mahavishnu took the form of a dam and stopped the river from destroying the yagna. Then Saraswati realized her mistake and prayed to Lord Mahavishnu. The yagna was completed successfully and Lord Vishnu gave the Varaas to all Devas. So he was known as Varadarajan. Iravatha, the elephant in DevaLoka became the hillock Atthigiri. Lord Devaraja or Varadaraja stood on that hillock and gave darshan to all.</p><p>Lord Varadharajan is also known as Devarajan and Perarulaalan. Thaayar name is Perundevi Thaayar.</p><p>So many Aachariars lived here. Among them Thirukkachi Nambi was the one who performed 'Aalavatta Sevai' to Lord Varadha, using a stick fan to drive away the sweat. Lord Varadha used to appear as a boy and talk to Thirukkachi Nambi regularly. Saint Ramanujar stayed in this Sthalam and learned the Veda. Swami Vedantha Desikan stayed here and performed service and composed a lot of slokas and paasurams on Lord Varadharaja</p><p>Adiyen composed a krithi on this shrine, tuned to the ragam Brindavana Saranga. Singers are Dr.Thatham and Mrs.Amutha. Please listen and enjoy.</p></span>",

He fought with Nakkayran and killed him simultaneously calmed down the anger of Kali.</p><p>Another incident which had a mention is giving Mukthi to the elephant Gajendran.

In this shrine Thirumazhisai aazhwaar stayed for some period. He had a disciple by name Kanikannan who was a devotee of Perumal composing and singing songs on Him. When Pallava king came to know about this he called Kanikannan and requested him to sing a song in praise of him. But Kanikannan refused. So the King ordered him to get out of Kanchi. When Kanikannan informed this to Thirumazhisai aazhwaar he prayed the Lord and informed Him that he is also leaving Kanchi with Kanikannan and hence the Lord may also kindly accompany them by rolling his serpent mat Aadhiseshan. Lord Mahavishnu immediately responded to Aazhwaar's request and left Kancheepuram along with them. When Mahavishnu started leaving with his devotees Mahalakshmi also also joined with them. The entire Kanchi lost it's glory and became dark.</p><p>When the King saw that the temple without the idols of the Lord and the glory of the entire city had disappeared he realised his mistake and went in search of Kanikannan and Thirumazhisai aazhwaar. After meeting them the King apologised for his wrond deed and requested the to return to Kancheepuram. Again Thirumazhisai aazhwaar prayed to Lord Mahavishnu to come back to Kancheepuram along with them and again lie on the serpent mat Aadhiseshan. Lord also obliged to Aazhwaar' s prayer and in a hurry He spread his serpent mat in opposite direction with the result He kept his head on his left side and legs on his right side. One can see this changed lying posture of the Lord in this shrine. Since he had done what Thirumazhisai aazhwaar told him to do he is known by the name Yathothkari in Sanskrit and Sonna vannam seitha perumal in Tamil. Thaayaar name is Komalavalli. This shrine is the birth place of Poigai aazhwar who was seen on a lotus flower in a pond here.</p><p>Adiyen composed a Krithi on this Lord and sang in a raagam known as Jana Sammohini. Singers are Dr.Thatham and Mrs.Amutha. Please listen and enjoy.</p></span>",

From that place one has to travel about 2 furlong in southern direction to reach this shrine.</p><p>The purana for this sthalam is similar to that of PullamBoothankudi. In both the places it was said that Lord Rama performed the final rituals for Jadaayu who came to rescue Sita while she was taken by Ravana in pushpaka Vimanam to Srilanka. At the time of performing rituals Rama kept the body of Jadaayu on his right lap. Due to the smell of the burning body of Jadaayu Sridevi usually on the right side Vishnu (born as Rama) moved to his left side.</p><p>Rama by sending an arrow brought a holy water as a pond to perform the final rituals. This pond is named as Jadaayu pushkarani. The temple authorities are of the opinion that the final rituals of Jadaayu performed by Lord Rama at Pullam Boothankudi was reenacted based on the request of Jadaayu put forth to Lord Narayana at Vaikuntam. He made the submission to Narayanan to give the same dharshan to all devotees coming to this shrine. The Thaayaar's name is Maragathavalli.</p><p>Women who are not blessed with child are asked to take bath in the Jadaayu pushkarani along with their respective husband. The priest of this temple hand over a small quantity of roasted pulses or other grains. Those women are asked to have these roasted grains after soaking in water and tying in their sarees. They have to sleep near the sannidhi of Thaayaar along with the grains in their sarees.The next day morning the grains will be examined. If these roasted grains start germinating they are sure to get the blessings of Thaayaar for pregnancy and healthy child. Hence the Thaayaar has a name 'வறுத்த பயறு முளைவித்த தாயார்'. This shrine has another importance. Aachariyar Ramanujarhad his early lessons of Vedhas here only in the gurukula of Yaadhava prakaasar.</p><p>Adiyen composed a krithi on this shrine tuned to a raagam கல்யாண வசந்தம்.

It is about a mile away from Arakkonam railway station.</p><p>The Sthala puranam goes like this: Once when Goddess Lakshmi at Thiruppaarkadal had a difference of opinion with her father Thiruppaarkadal arasan and with anger she came down to earth and reached this place. She stood here. Since Lakshmi is known as திரு in Tamil this place was called as திருநின்றவூர். Thiruppaarkadal arasan came here and prayed to Lakshmi to calm down and come back to Thiruppaarkadal. But she didn't. So he went to Lord Mahavishnu and prayed to console her. So Lord Mahavishnu came here and pacified her. Lakshmi cooled down and offered the posture of marriage with Lord Vishnu to Thiruppaarkadal arasan. He was happy and prayed them to show this to all bhakthaas.</p><p>With great affinity to his daughter Thiruppaarkadal arasan called Lakshmi as என்னைப் பெற்ற தாயார். Since the Lord Mahavishnu came down based on his bhakthan's prayer he got the name பக்தவத்சலப் பெருமாள். Once when Thirumangai aazhwaar crossed this shrine he didn't compose any paasuram on this deity (probably the temple wasn't open). Realising this Thaayaar requested Perumal to go and meet Aazhwaar and get the paasuram. Bhakthavathsala Perumal followed Aazhwaar and could reach him only at Thirukadal mallai (Mahabalipuram) where he was praising Thalasayana perumal. Upon seeing him at this shrine Aazhvaar praised him also in in  paasuram. Perumal came back to Thirunindravur and showed the paasuram to Lakshmi when she asked him whether he could get only one paasuram and asked him to go back to Aazhvaar and get some more. Lord Vishnu again came in search of Aazhvaar by that time Aazhvaar reached Thirukkannamangai. Upon seeing the lord's arrival again Aazhvaar composed one more paasuram on him and Perumal came back to Thirunindravur and showed it to Thaayaar and made her happy.</p><p>Adiyen composed a krithi on this shrine tuned to Shree raagam. Singers are Dr.Thatham and Mrs.Amutha. Please listen and enjoy.</p></span>",

Presently it is a suburb of Chennai on the road route to Thiruppathi. The shrine was quoted in Markandeya purana.</p><p>During Krutha Yuga Burupunniya and his wife performed an yaga called Sali yanga at Badri seeking blessings of Lord Narayana for a child.Lord Narayanan blessed them and asked them to name their son Salihothran. When Salihothran became an adult he took up an yathra to different shines and holy places. He reached a forest here and saw a pond where Devas used to come and take a holy dip in it. He constructed a hut with a parnashala and performed Pooja regularly. Everyday he used to feed a guest and then only had his food. One day he had wait for a long time for the arrival of a guest. Lord Narayana came in a disguise as an old man for his house as a guest on that day. Salihothra was very happy to receive him and offered food. After taking food the old man told him that he was very tired and wanted to lie down and sleep. He asked Salihithra where was the room to sleep (எவ்வுள்). Saint Salihothra showed a small place near his parnashala and told this was the place to sleep (இவ்வுள்). When the guest in the disguise of an old man lied down he showed that he was Lord Narayana. Saint Salihothra was very happy to the lord in front of him when Lord Narayana asked him his wish. He immediately requested that Lord may please remain there permanently in that posture and bless all bhakthaas. Lord Narayana accepted and blessed him with his hand on the head of Salihothra.</p><p>Moolavar Veeraragava perumal is also known as எவ்வுள் கிடந்தான் Thaayaar's name is கனகவல்லி (வஸுமதி).

      "<span><p>The 60th Divya Desam towards which are proceeding our musical journey is திருவல்லிக்கேணி. The temple is a 6th century one located near the sea shore of Bay of Bengal in Chennai. This shrine was reported in Brahmanda purana as forest with a dense population of holy herb Thulasi.</p><p>Once a king named Sumathi was praying to Lord Venkatesha at Thirumala to show his appearance of Partha Sarathi to him. Lord Venkatesha directed him to go to this place and see that. On that direction the king reached here and saw the Partha Sarathi roopa of Lord Vishnu. That is why the lord here is known as Venkata Krishna meaning the Krishna shown by Venkatesha of Thirumala to his devotee King Sumathi. The presiding deity in the main Sanctum sanctorum is Lord Krishna in a standing posture with his characteristic mustache as he was the driver (sarathy) of the chariot of Partha (Arjuna).</p><p>In this Sanctum sanctorum itself in addition to Lord Krishna five other deities are also seen. They are Rukmini Thaayaar, Balaraman (elder brother of Krishna), Saathyagi (a great Yaadhava warrior devoted to Kishna and who took training in shooting arrows under Dhrona along with Arjuna during their early days of schooling), Pradyumna (eldest son of Krishna and Rukmini), Aniruddha son of Pradyumna (grand son of Krishna). The urchavar is Partha Sarathi with characteristic hit impressions of arrows on his face at Kurukshetra. In addition to these presiding deities four other forms of Lord Vishnu are seen in 4 different Sanctums. They are Lord Narasimha ( as per the prayers of sage Atthiri), Lord Rama (as per the prayers of Madhuman Rishi), Lord Gajendra varadhar (as per the prayers of Saint Saptharomar), Lord Renganathan (as per the wishes of Vadavalli Thaayaar). This shrine was praised by PeyAazhwaar, Thirumazhisai Aazhvaar and Thirumangai aazhwaar in Divyaprabandham.</p><p>Adiyen composed a krithi on Venkata Krishnan of Thiruvallikeni tuned to the raagam கலாவதி.

Since the water surrounds the hill during heavy rains this hill was known as Neer malai.</p><p>Once  Rishi Valmiki camehere and worshipped Renga Nathan Narasimhan and Thirivikraman. When he came down the hill he had a little dissatisfaction as he was fond of witnessing Lord Mahavishnu in the roopa of Rama. So he prayed for the dharshan of Rama. To satisfy his prayers Lord Renganatha came in the roopa of Rama while Lakshmi as Sita, Aadhiseshan as Lakshmana, Shang as Bharatha, Chakkara as Chathrukina, Vishwaksenar as Sugreeva and Garudan as Hanuman. Valmiki prayed to show the Neervannan roopa (Rama) to all bakthas who visit this temple which the lord accepted.</p><p>Once Thirumangai aazhwaar came here for dharshan when there was were heavy rains. The entire hill was surrounded by water for a period of six months. He waited in the nearby village till the rains stopped and the water drained completely. He reached the temple and worshipped the lord by composing 19 paasurams. The place where Thirumangai aazhwaar stayed is now known as Thirumangai aazhwaar puram. Bhudhathaazhwar praised this lord in one paasuram. The presiding deity in the foothill is Neervannan and Thaayaar's name is Animaamalar mangai in addition to three other deities on the hill mentioned earlier.</p><p>Adiyen composed a krithi on this Divya Desam and tuned in a raagam known as KARNA RANJANI.

This Divya Desam is situated near Kovalam on the route of Chennai to Mahabalipuram at a distance of about 12 miles from Mahabalipuram. This sthalam is mentioned in Varahapuranam.</p><p>During Krutha Yuga Lord Narayana appeared as Varaha roopi before king Bali for his thapa at this place and this place was known as Vamakavipuri or Varahapuri. In yet another time one Rishi Kalava (based on the request of Saint Naradha) married a rishi daughter called Kuni and they gave birth to 365 daughters who were the incarnation of goddess Lakshmi. When they were trying to get their daughters married a few saints who came from Varahapuri asked them to go there and pray Varaha for the early marriage. Kalavarishi reached Varahapuri and performed thapa. Lord Varaha came there as a bachelor and told him that he had returned after Divyadesa pilgrimage tour. Kalavarishi requested him to marry his 365 daughters. The man replied that he will marry them one by one every day during the year. On the last day he made all the 365 brides in to one roopa called Akilavalli and held her on his left thigh and took Varaha roopa. As the mahalakshmi is on the left side of Varaha he is known as Thiru Ida Enthai.</p><p>Urchavar is known by the name Nithya kalyana perumal. The name of the first lakshmi (first daughter of Kalavarishi) who married the lord on the first day was Komalavalli. She has a separate sannidhi as a paraellal presiding deity. Many prospective bachelor boys and girls who come to this shrine and pray for early marriage and happy married life. Their requests are fulfilled by this Lord and after marriage they again visit the temple and offer their thanks and gratitude to the lord for His blessings. The Varahamurthy in this shrine was praised by Thirumangai aazhwaar in 13 paasurams.</p><p>Adiyen composed a krithi on this shrine and tuned to raagam Gowlai. Singers are Dr.Thatham and Mrs.Amutha.

When he was interrupted by the ocean he tried to clear the water of ocean. Upon seeing his bhakthi Lord Mahavishnu appeared before him in disguise as an elderly person and asked for food, the rishi handed over the flower basket to him asked him to wait near the sea shore so that he could go back to his hut and bring food. Meanwhile Mahavishnu took his original form adorned himself with the flowers tied by Rishi and had a sleeping posture on Aadhiseshan as in Thiruppaarkadal on the sea shore. When the rishi returned he understood the elderly person he met was none other than Mahavishnu. The rishi was so happy and prayed the lord to bless him by permitting him to sit near His holy feet and lord permitted. Since the Lord laid himself on Aadhiseshan in the ground of sea shore without any throne he was designated as தலசயனப் பெருமாள்.

It is about 25 km from Arakonam RS.</p><p>This sthalam had a mention in Vishnu puranam where it was indicated that sage Viswamithra came to this hill and performed thapa to see Lord Narasimha. When he had the strong prayer for a period of one கடிகை or நாழிகை viz., 24 minutes Lord Narasimha appeared before him.</p><p>Similarly during the end of Thredhayuga Saptharishis when performed thapa to see Lord they were disturbed by two demons Kaalan and Keyan. At that period when Lord Rama was preparing to proceed to Vaikuntam Hanuman wanted to accompany him. Rama told Hanuman to go to this hill and fight with the demons to protect the rishis. When Hanuman had a long fight with the demons he became very tired. He prayed Rama for a solution when Rama appeared and gave him Shank and Chakra with those help Hanuman killed them and saved the thapa of rishis. Praising their sustained efforts Mahavishnu appeared as Lord Narasimha which Hanuman also saw and praised Narasimha through Bajan. Lord Narasimha asked Hanuman to stay there in yoga posture similar to him till the end of Kaliyuga. One can see Hanuman in the neighbouring hill in yoga posture with shank and chakra on the shoulders.</p><p>It is believed that if a person stays in this sthalam and prays for a time of one கடிகை or நாழிகை (24 minutes) he or she will be blessed with Mukthi or Moksham. அசலம் means hill hence the name கடிகாசலம். The presiding deity is Yoga Narasimhar and he is praised as Akkaara kani by Thirumangai aazhwaar in his paasuram. Peyaazhwaar also praised this shrine in his paasuram.

Lord Vaamana who was the 5th incarnation of lord Mahavishnu was born on a Thiruvonam star to sage Kashyapa and Adhithi. He was dwarf in stature. Vaamana went to him seeking for a Biksha of three feet land as per the measurement of his own feet. Upon seeing the small stature of the boy and his request Mahabali was laughing and accepted to donate the piece of land to him. Immediately Vaamana took the form of huge figure of Thirivikrama reaching sky height and started measuring the earth and sky with his two feet. When he asked Mahabali where to step for the third feet measurement king Mahabali realised his mistake bowed before Thirivikrama and requested him to step on his head. Mahavishnu pushed him to paathaala loka but gave him Mukthi. Based on the request of Mahabali lord permitted him to visit his hometown and citizens once a year that is on the birthday of lord Vaamana the Thiruvonam star of the month Aavani which is celebrated as Oonam.</p><p>Once a farmer was growing banana crop in this region.

So they prayed the king to help them. King Rukmangatha brought them in front of this deity and gave away all 'Punyas' by which the Devas were relieved of their sin and they reached their divine world.</p><p>All these were said to have happened in a time of one 'Kadigai' or Naazhingai 'நாழிகை' that is 24 minutes.

This shrine was supposed to have been established on the first day of beginning of Kaliyuga. Once Saint Dhivakara of Thulu region of Malayala Desam performed Thapa to see the Sheerapthi nadhan viz., Mahavishnu in Paarkadal. Appreciating his prayer Mahavishnu appeared before himas a two years old boy baby. Upon seeing the beauty of the child the saint requested the child to be with him. The child accepted with a condition that so far he is not disturbed he will stay with the saint.</p><p>One day the child took a saligram of saint's Pooja put in his mouth and bit. On seeing this the saint was angry and tried to beat the child. The child ran away from him and entered into a forest . The saint ran behind him into the forest but couldn't locate the child. Finally on the big hole of an iluppai tree he found the child. When he tried to catch hold of child the tree suddenly fell down and the child changed as Anandha Sayana Perumal who grew broad so that the head portion was 3 miles away from the port of Ananthapuram while leg portion was 5 miles away at Thiruppapuram. The body portion was at Thiruvanathapuram.</p><p>Upon seeing this huge stature of Mahavishnu the saint was surprised and frightened. Based on his request Mahavishnu constricted his size and appeared before him.Prohithas of Thulu descendants are still performing the poojas in the temple. Another Namboothiri saint was worshipping the lord every day. One day when he couldn't find anything to offer to Lord Mahavishnu he plucked a few raw mango fruits placed on a coconut shell and offered. This practice is still continued in the regular Pooja of the temple even today. This shrine was renovated a few times and still descendants of Raja Marthanda Varma are administering the temple. Swami Nammaazhvar praised this shrine in 11 paasurams. Perumal name is Anandha Padma Naaban while Thaayaar is Shree Hari Lakshmi.</p><p>One can make dharshan of the lord as three portion of the long stature of him as Head (திருமுடி)chest and naabi and feet (திருவடி).</p><p>Adiyen composed a krithi on this lord tuned to ragam நீலாம்பரி.
